# Issues?
If you encounter any issues after installing this extension, I kindly ask you to follow these steps:

1. First, try disabling my extension and see if the issue persists.
2. Check for any conflicting extensions or browser settings that might be causing the problem.
3. If the issue persists only when my extension is enabled, please report it here.

When submitting a bug report, please include as much detail as possible, such as your browser version, operating system, website you were testing, and any error messages encountered.

Thank you in advanced!

# How to use?

> You will **NOT** find this extension on the Chrome Webstore or any other extension platform! If you do find it there, it wasn't published by me and may contain malicious code.

## Chrome

Click on the green <> Code Button -> Download the repo as a zip -> Unzip it somewhere safe -> Goto ```chrome://extensions/``` -> Enable developer mode -> Load unpacked -> Load unzipped directory

You can then access options by clicking on the icon, and clicking on the 'options' button, which will bring you to the page.

## Firefox

Click on the green <> Code Button -> Download the repo as a zip -> Unzip it somewhere safe -> Goto ```about:addons``` -> Debug Add-ons -> Load Temporary Add-on -> Load unzipped directory

You can then access options by clicking on the extensions icon in the top right, clicking the cog wheel and go 'Manage Extension' then click on the 'Options' tab. 

# How to rip?

Go to a compatible WebGL website, then press the Insert key on your keyboard and it should then begin downloading.

> The downloaded textures may not be the correct size and you'll have to manually resize them, this is a current known limitation.

> The website may request permission to download multiple files; be sure to allow this, or alternatively, navigate to the extension options and enable Download as ZIP.
